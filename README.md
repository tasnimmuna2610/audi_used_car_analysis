1. I've counted the numbers of cars using different types of fuels, transmission systems, models. I've counted the number of different models of audi cars bought over years and then showed them in barplots to get the full sense of the dataset.
2. Showed scatterplots of how the prices changed according to mileage, mpg and enginesize and then found which relationship worked. I've added hue parameters to show how prices varied with transmission and mileage.
3. Made histogram and distribution plot to show how prices varied with numbers of cars bought.
4. Plotted ECDF to show the feature of car prices with numer of cars bought, it's probability and probability varied by different types of transmissions.
5. Created boxplots of different numeric variables and it's change with transmission
